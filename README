Notes from
"WHEN EVERYTHING LOOKS LIKE A NAIL"
The Matt & Markus show @ Open Source Bridge 2010

If you want to see how the sausage is made, you're in the right spot. 
We've left the history intact for the curious. The folders are as follows:

ed - Fibonacci demo with ed, the bestest editor ever.
m4 - The terrifyingly strange configuration system from an alternate reality. (?)
meta - Some gibberish to do with the talk, including a gag we didn't use and an early outline.
music - Code for the math-with-harmonics demo.
one_armed_man - Constraint programming code where a one-armed man makes breakfast.
presentation - Our Slidy-based preso. Our first time using Slidy. It wasn't bad.
sqlgraphics - Code for rendering a pretty picture of JELLO in SQL.
sqlweb - An ill-fated attempt to continue the SQL use/abuse. You'll get the idea from the code.

We had a lot of fun presenting. We hope you had fun watching. For those of 
you who expressed interest, we hope you'll have more fun tweaking what we've 
made here. We'd love to have your contributions to make these demos work even 
better, or do even more unexpected things.

Enjoy!

Markus + Matt

[ We see Markus fiddling with a box of some sort. It says "Turing Machine" on the side.

Matt: What's that?
Markus: Oh this is a Turing Machine. I got it on Ebay.
[Markus is feeding in a paper tape into the machine.]

Matt: Sweet. What's it do?
Markus: You're about to see.

[Markus messes with machine]

<< We have a second laptop connected to a boombox, ready to make noise. >>

Markus: Ok, here goes nothing.
[Markus activates device]

Computer voice: Shit, shit, shit. Shut your damned mouth. Crap. Damn. Hell. Shit. Dammit. 

[Markus scrambles to turn it off.]

Matt: Um... is it supposed to do that?

Markus: No! I don't understand it.
[Markus looks at machine more.]

[Matt looks at "Turing Machine" label]

Matt: Where did you say you got this?

Markus: Ebay. The seller feedback said "A+++ would buy again"

[Matt starts to peel off "Turing" sticker off to reveal a "Tourette's" label instead.]

Matt: Um... This might explain the problem.
